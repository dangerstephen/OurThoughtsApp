 #Planning and Execution:
 
As we worked we worked on the project we used ([Trello](https://trello.com/b/0IcVo5BL/project-1)) to set things we needed to do and track when they were done. This helped us know what the next step was along the whole procces and to insure that we got all the things we origianlly planned to done.
